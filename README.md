## Quiz Questions Project Outline ##

### Goal: ###
The goal of this project is to create a pop-up quiz for the user to take. 


### Background: ### 
Do you ever worry that when you’re learning something new,  that you’re just going to forget everything you’ve learned? Maybe you’ll right it down, but will you ever read it again? This project serves as a way for me to store important information that I don’t want to forget, and I can periodically quiz myself on it. 


### Features: ###
-	Questions about topics I am personally interested in such as Software Development, Hardware Development and Spanish. 
-	The ability for the user to choose what kind of quiz they want
-	Every question credits the source of the question


### How it works: ###
-	When the program is run a pop-up will be rendered asking the user a series of questions:
1.	What topic would you like to choose? (answers are given as buttons)
2.	How many questions would you like to answer?
-	The user will then be presented with questions 1-by-1 and get a score at the end with a list of questions they got wrong

### Next Steps: ###
0 Learn Tkinter


### Future Development Thoughts: ###
-	Try to complete this project in other languages (JS, Java)

### Problems I've Run Into: ###
- color in tkinter doesn't work on mac
